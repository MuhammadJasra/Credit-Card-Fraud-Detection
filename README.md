# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection, A machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions using EDA, feature engineering, and classification algorithms** like Logistic Regression &amp; Random Forest. Evaluated with accuracy, precision, and recall for reliability. 

->ðŸš€ Features  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
- **Feature Engineering for Fraud Detection**  
- **Supervised Machine Learning Models**  
- **Model Evaluation using Performance Metrics**  

->Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  

-> ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The system is trained on a credit card transaction dataset that contains details such as transaction amount, time, and fraud labels.  

-> How It Works  
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify fraud trends.  
3. Train machine learning models to classify transactions as fraud or legitimate.  
4. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
